# Passion.Project
Hello, 
My passion project will demonstrate a many-to-many relationship between electronic devices and different retailers and a one-to-many relationship between electronic devices and their brand.
the admin interface will be able to perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update and Delete) on each of the entity items: Products, Brands, and Retailers.
For continues development, I would like to work more on the design and develop more features such as user review for each product and update current features for example the administrator to be able to update prices as part of CMS, as of now it can only be updated from the database by the developer.

I hope you enjoy it, 
Thanks, 
Yifat.
